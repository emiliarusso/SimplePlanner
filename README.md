## Overview
**SimplePlanner** is a global planner for mobile robots, built in **C++** and integrated with **ROS**. It computes a collision-free path between the robot’s current position and a user-defined goal on a 2D occupancy map.  
The core of the planner is an **A\*** search algorithm, improved with a **clearance-based cost function** that penalizes paths closer to obstacles.  
This ensures that the robot not only finds a feasible route but also maximizes safety margins from walls and obstacles.  

The project is designed as a minimal example of how to implement grid-based path planning in ROS, providing both functionality and visualization tools to understand how the planner expands and selects the final path.


## How It Works
The planning process in **SimplePlanner** can be divided into four main stages, each of which transforms the raw map and user input into a feasible, safe, and smooth trajectory.

### 1. Map handling
The planner starts from a **2D occupancy map** provided by the standard ROS `map_server`.  
This map is a `nav_msgs/OccupancyGrid` where each cell can be:
- `0` → free space  
- `100` → occupied (obstacle)  
- `-1` → unknown  

The occupancy grid can be converted into a `grid_map_msgs/GridMap` through the `occ_to_gridmap` bridge node, which stores data in a layered grid structure. Regardless of representation, the map is discretized with resolution `r` (meters per cell), and all subsequent computations happen in this grid space.

### 2. Obstacle extraction & costmap generation
Once the map is available, the planner extracts obstacles and computes a **clearance costmap**.  
This involves two key steps:

1. **Distance transform (DT)**  
   Starting from obstacle cells, a **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** expansion propagates through the grid and assigns each free cell the distance $d(i)$ to its nearest obstacle.  
   In practice:

   $$d(i) = \min_{j \in \mathrm{Obstacles}} \; \lVert p_i - p_j \rVert_2$$

   where $p_i$ is the position of cell $i$ in world coordinates.

2. **Clearance-based cost function**  
   Each cell is assigned a traversal penalty that increases as the clearance decreases.  
   The cost is defined as:

   $$c(i) = \frac{\alpha}{\varepsilon + d(i)}$$

   where:
   - $\alpha$ is a tunable weight (`alpha_clearance`)
   - $\varepsilon$ is a small constant to avoid division by zero
   - $d(i)$ is the distance to the closest obstacle

This ensures that paths running close to walls or obstacles become more expensive, encouraging the planner to prefer safer routes.

### 3. Planning (A*)

With the costmap available, the planner runs the **A\*** search algorithm over the grid.

- **Start pose:** automatically retrieved from TF (`map → base_link`) or manually set by the user through `/initialpose`.
- **Goal pose:** provided via `/move_base_simple/goal` (a `geometry_msgs/PoseStamped`) or via `/move_base/goal` (an action message).

For each candidate move from a cell $i$ to a neighbor $j$, the incremental cost is:

$$
g(j) \;=\; g(i) \;+\; \Delta d(i,j) \;+\; c(j)
$$

where:
- $\Delta d(i,j)$ is the Euclidean step cost (1 for horizontal/vertical, $\sqrt{2}$ for diagonal moves).
- $c(j)$ is the clearance penalty from the costmap.

The **heuristic** $h(j)$ is the straight-line distance from cell $j$ to the goal:

$$
h(j) \;=\; \sqrt{(x_j - x_g)^2 \;+\; (y_j - y_g)^2}
$$

The A\* priority is then:

$$
f(j) \;=\; g(j) \;+\; h(j)
$$

This makes the planner both **admissible** (A\* guarantees the shortest-cost path with this heuristic) and **safety-aware** (thanks to the clearance cost term).

### 4. Path output & visualization

Once the goal is reached, the planner reconstructs the path by backtracking through parent links.
The raw path is published as a `nav_msgs/Path`, containing an ordered sequence of poses in the `map` frame.

To make the trajectory smoother and visually clearer, an optional **Chaikin’s corner-cutting algorithm** is applied. This iteratively refines the polyline by generating new intermediate points:

$$
P'_k \;=\; 0.75\,P_k \;+\; 0.25\,P_{k+1} \\
Q'_k \;=\; 0.25\,P_k \;+\; 0.75\,P_{k+1}
$$

After a few iterations, the path resembles a smooth curve instead of a jagged polyline.

For visualization, the system publishes:
- **Final path** → blue line (`/simple_planner/path`)
- **Start & goal markers** → blue sphere (start), green sphere (goal)
- **Debug markers**:
  - `/simple_planner/frontier` → frontier cells explored during A\*
  - `/simple_planner/visited` → visited/expanded cells
  - `/simple_planner/cost_debug` → clearance-weighted costmap as an `OccupancyGrid`

This allows the user to follow in RViz not only the final path but also the **internal decision process** of the planner.
